# Summary

The [Owlet Smart Sock](https://owletcare.com/) is a product designed to track a baby's heart rate, oxygen levels and sleep using pulse oximetry. This project is intended to read this data programmatically via a reverse-engineered API.

This project [mbevand/owlet_monitor](https://github.com/mbevand/owlet_monitor) inspired this project and has done all the hardwork in reverse-engineering the April 2020 version.
